Super is used to access parent class methods and attributes from the child class's scope.

âš  Note the super constructor should be called before any initialization of the child class members.
```
public Car(int price,int milage,String fuelType,String manufacturer,int tax){  
    super(4,5,price,milage);  
    this.fuelType = fuelType;  
    this.manufacturer = manufacturer;  
    this.tax = tax;  
}
```
