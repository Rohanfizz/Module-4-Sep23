- Not complete Class
- Some methods might be  implemented some might not be implemented, which are to implemented in the child classs
- Some times I cannot implement a method in the parent class (I cannot generalize things for all the child classes) So I want java to remind me to implement those methods separately in the child classes.
- Making parent class, an abstract class and giving it some abstract methods will force any child class to implement those methods.
- Abstract classes **cannot have their own objects**
